<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
A standard Sudoku contains 81 cells, in a 9Ã—9 grid, and has 9 boxes, each box being the intersection of the first, middle, or last 3 rows, and the first, middle, or last 3 columns. Each cell may contain a number from one to nine, and each number can only occur once in each row, column, and box.
Sudoku Solver uses an algorithm to solve the 
sudoku with efficient space and time complexity.
It can solve any sudoku either its easy or 
difficult.
